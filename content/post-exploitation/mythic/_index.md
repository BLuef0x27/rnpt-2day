## Mythic C2 Profiles
Mythic supports a wide array of what the team calls C2 Profiles.  You can refer to the official documentation for a proper

with different types of agents or payloads.

You can see which C2 profiles as well as which payloads you have installed by visitng the */new/c2profiles* path on 
your localhost mythic server.
